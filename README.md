# Peer-group-Lending-Regression

The Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending site where members make loans to each other. 
The site makes anonymized data on loans and borrowers publicly available.

Business Problem: How can we predict interest rates based on borrower and loan attributes?

Statistical solution is to build a Linear regression model for the dependent variable InterestRate and
all other independent variables.
